At the time of publication, [Essendon](http://www.essendonfc.com.au/) are clearly the best side in the AFL. (Perhaps I am displaying a tiny little bit of bias here.) They are the best side for two reasons:
1. Only recent form matters (and Essendon have been doing much better recently), and
2. The AFL fixture is not fair - each team plays 12 teams once, and only 5 teams twice, and some sets of 5 teams are easier to beat than others. i.e. it's easier to look good with a soft draw (I'm looking at you, Collingwood).

[This code](https://github.com/smcateer/super_ladder) can be used to calculate a version of the ladder which aims takes these effects into account. It does this by allowing you to exclude all but the most recent rounds (the parameter `rnd_cnt`), and scaling the points you get for a win by the quality of your opposition, using the opposing team's *percentage* as a proxy for quality (the parameter `scale_power`).

The points you get for a win are \\( 4 r^p \\) for a win, and \\( 2 r^p \\) for a draw, where \\( r \\) is the opposition's percentage (as calculated on a standard ladder as a number between 0 and 1) and \\( p \\) is a parameter used to adjust the impact of the opposition's percentage on the points awarded.

Setting \\( p \\) = 0 corresponds to the standard ladder (i.e. \\( r^p \\) = 1), setting \\( p \\) = 1 means that beating two teams with \\( r \\) = 50% is equivalent to beating one team with \\( r \\) = 100%. I think \\( p \\) = 2 is a good value, it means that you need to beat 2 teams with \\( r \\) = 71% (or 4 teams with \\( r \\) = 50%) to get the points equivalent to beating one team with \\( r \\) = 100%.

Anyway, below are the results (at the end of round 19, 2018).

Here is the standard ladder:

Note that Collingwood move from 3rd on the ladder to 9th - hard evidence that Collingwood suck. Melbourne also take a hit, and Essendon do quite well moving up to 6th.

Much has been made of Essendon's slow start to the season, here's what the ladder looks like when you only consider rounds 9 to 19 inclusive (i.e. 11 rounds or 10 games when you allow for the byes):
```
> super_ladder(rnd_cnt=11) # ladder for rounds 9 to 19

                TEAM  POINTS  SCORE  OPPONENT_SCORE  PERCENTAGE
0        Collingwood    32.0    991             747  132.663989
1           Essendon    32.0    876             711  123.206751
2      Port Adelaide    28.0    784             596  131.543624
3           Richmond    28.0    932             723  128.907331
4         GWS Giants    28.0    884             762  116.010499
5          Melbourne    24.0   1087             777  139.897040
6           Hawthorn    24.0    888             697  127.403156
7            Geelong    24.0    894             757  118.097754
8             Sydney    24.0    827             733  112.824011
9         West Coast    24.0    822             740  111.081081
10   North Melbourne    24.0    921             843  109.252669
11          Brisbane    16.0    912             871  104.707233
12          Adelaide    16.0    725             884   82.013575
13          St Kilda    12.0    775             962   80.561331
14         Fremantle    12.0    655             931   70.354458
15  Western Bulldogs     4.0    593             982   60.386965
16           Carlton     4.0    568             999   56.856857
17        Gold Coast     4.0    526             945   55.661376

I like this even better, Essendon move to 2nd. But what about Collingwood? Surely nobody can deserve to be top of the ladder with their  easy draw. (Why rounds 9 to 19? Well may you ask. It could be argued that this is the choice that most favours Essendon ... never claimed to be unbiased!)

Finally, let's include both effects (recent form and opposition quality):
```
> super_ladder(scale_power=2, rnd_cnt=11)

                TEAM     POINTS  SCORE  OPPONENT_SCORE  PERCENTAGE

15  Western Bulldogs   5.578832    593             982   60.386965

```
That's the result I wanted! Essendon on top where they belong.

If this is a fair indication of the current form in the AFL, Essendon may end up rueing their slow start to the season. Pretty tough to be spectators in a finals series when you look like you could have had an impact. 

BTW, there's not much original thought here ... there are online interactive sites that allow calculation of form ladders (although I didn't see any that allow for opposition quality). [This](http://formladder.com.au/afl/) one even allows you to pile together multiple seasons into a single ladder (very interesting).
