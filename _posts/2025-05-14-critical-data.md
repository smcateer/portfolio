This audit was prompted by observations made during previous audits regarding the quality of agency data. The audit focused on compliance with the Victorian Government data quality regulations. It was one of the fastest and least costly audits ever conducted by VAGO.

The importance of the findings of this audit highlights the importance of the Data Science team having input not only in data analysis but also in VAGO's annual planning.
