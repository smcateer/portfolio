We analysed the Department of Families, Fairness and Housing’s (DFFH) compliance with child wellbeing regulations by running metrics across its child protection data. Our audit also highlighted broader issues with the quality of this data. We found that DFFH lacks adequate controls to ensure high-quality child protection data. Our analysis included checks for outliers, missing values, and logical inconsistencies, but most of our focus was on reviewing DFFH’s data management processes and procedures. For more details, see the [Kinship Care](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/kinship-care) report and our follow-up that focused on data quality in child protection in general [Quality of Child Protection Data](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/quality-child-protection-data).

Due to the nature of the material, this was a very challenging piece of analysis to work on - one moment you'd be working on some piece of analysis of a table of data, and the next the full gravity of the subject matter would hit you.

*[Kinship Care](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/kinship-care) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 22 June 2022 and [Quality of Child Protection Data](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/quality-child-protection-data) on 21 September 2022.*
