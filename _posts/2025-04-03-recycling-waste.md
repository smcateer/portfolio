The main contribution I made to this engagement was the development of interactive visualizations embedded within the audit report. This approach hoped to enhance the engagement of the report for our audience. It also served as a proof of concept for future audits.

The following chart is an example of one of the interactive visualizations created for the report. The level of interactivity isn't mind-blowing, but it is enough to make the reader less passive without getting in the way of the content.

**Figure 10: Total waste recovered and entering landfill from households and businesses, 2022–23**
