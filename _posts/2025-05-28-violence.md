A member of my team analysed the department’s eduSafe Plus incident-recording system across a ten-year period, cleaning and standardising the data to make it comparable across schools and time. They profiled reporting patterns, built trend indicators adjusted for staffing levels, and segmented incidents by source, type and severity to reveal how work-related violence is changing and where risks concentrate.

They then cross-validated the data against internal OHS documentation to identify gaps in reporting caused by misclassification, inconsistent coding and exclusions. This reconciliation work highlighted systemic weaknesses in the department’s data processes and directly informed the audit’s findings on the need for more reliable, comprehensive and timely incident data to support staff safety decisions.

For the results of the analysis and the audit findings they generated, see [the full report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/work-related-violence-government-schools).
