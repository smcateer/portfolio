Two members of my team collaborated on the follow-up audit by updating and extending the original analysis with new data and a refreshed interactive dashboard that tracks tram-accessibility metrics across the network. They re-processed historical and recent operational records, rebuilt the accessibility indicators and visualised changes over time so the audit team could clearly see where improvements had occurred and where barriers persisted.

They also worked together to reconcile inconsistent route and stop information, identify missing or ambiguous data and flag gaps in the coverage of accessible infrastructure. This joint analysis helped the audit form a clear, evidence-based view of progress since the original report and highlight where further upgrades remain necessary.

In addition to supporting the audit, the tool itself offers a unique public benefit for mobility-impaired tram users. It provides a clear, map-based view of which stops and routes are accessible and where gaps exist. By putting this information into an intuitive dashboard, it gives users who rely on accessible stops a practical way to anticipate barriers and make informed decisions about their transport needs.
