Each year, VAGO tables reports in Parliament summarizing the results of financial audits for various sectors, including local government and education. These reports provide transparency regarding the financial performance and sustainability of public sector entities.

The data science team played a pivotal role in modernizing how these results are presented. Collaborating closely with financial audit team to produce interactive online dashboards. This process involves:

*   **Data pipeline development:** Engineering robust and verifiable data entry pipelines to transform financial data from dozens of entities.
*   **Visualization design:** Working with auditors to determine the most effective visualizations for key financial indicators.
*   **Dashboard implementation:** Building and deploying interactive dashboards (using Power BI) that allow users to filter data by entity, year, or sector, enabling deeper exploration of financial results.

In the coming years, I would like to expand the use of these dashboards to cover additional sectors and place them on an more unified platform for easier access. Watch this space!
