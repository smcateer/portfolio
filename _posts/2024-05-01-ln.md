Members of my team analysed longitudinal NAPLAN data to understand how literacy and numeracy outcomes have changed over time for different groups of Victorian students. They cleaned and linked multiple years of student- and school-level data, identified key cohorts such as Aboriginal students, students experiencing disadvantage and those with English as an additional language, and calculated the proportions performing below expected achievement levels. They also examined how these patterns varied across domains and school years to build a clearer picture of where gaps emerge and persist.
