I recently had the pleasure of being interviewed by Conor McGarrity and Yusuf Moolla from [Risk Insights](https://riskinsights.com.au/) on the [Auditing with Data](https://riskinsights.com.au/auditing-with-data-podcast) podcast. We discussed the use of data science in performance auditing, drawing on experiences from recent audits conducted at the Victorian Auditor-General's Office (VAGO).
