Last weekend, while watching my son's footy team ([GO BEARS!](https://bhfcbears.com.au/)), my dad noticed that the Bears' score, 7-7-49, had an unusual property, the score (calculated as 6 times the number of goals `g` plus the number of behinds `b`) was also the product of the goals and behinds. He posed the question: 'Are there any *other* scores that have this property?' Off the top of my head, it struck me that the score of 0-0-0, also satisfies the equation.

The next day, my dad emails me with two other solutions 4-8-32 and 3-9-27, and posed the question: 'Are these all the solutions, and how would you prove that you have them all?' So here it is:

So we are looking for cases when
`6g + b = gb`
implies that `g = b/(b - 6)`
(where `g` is the number of goals and `b` is the number of behinds).
Note that we need `g, b >= 0` and `g, b` whole numbers (hence Diophantine).

Also note that we need to have `2(b-6) <= b` implies `b \le 12` because otherwise `g` would not be a whole number, this limits the number of possible solutions.
Also also note that the right hand side has `b-6` in the denominator, so for `g` to be positive (and finite), we need `b>6`.

We can therefore proceed by brute-force and check all allowed values of \\(b\\):
{% raw %}
\begin{align}
b = 7, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{7}{1} = 7 \\\\\\\\
b = 8, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{8}{2} = 4 \\\\\\\\
b = 9, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{9}{3} = 3 \\\\\\\\
b = 10, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{10}{4} \\\\\\\\
b = 11, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{11}{5} \\\\\\\\
b = 12, g = \frac{b}{b-6} &= \frac{12}{6} = 2
\end{align}
{% endraw %}
Which gives us the solutions noted above, plus one new one 2-12-24 (the cases `b=10,11` don't provide us with whole goals). And that's it. QED :)

Here is a plot of goals versus behinds, where you can see the integer solutions:

(Bonus: Check out the extra solutions if you allow *anti-goals*!)

(I think) there are actually a surprising number of solutions here. How would this work out if a goal was worth a different number of points (5, 7, 8, ...)?
