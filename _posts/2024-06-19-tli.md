The TLI provides small-group tutoring (2–5 students) to support those whose learning has been disrupted or fallen behind in literacy and numeracy. Members of my team collated student-level assessment data (specifically the Progressive Achievement Test in reading and mathematics), matched participation data in TLI and non-participation cohorts, and constructed a statistical analysis framework to test whether participating students gained more than comparable non-tutored peers.

They then used regression-based modelling and baseline-matched comparisons to control for prior achievement, thereby mitigating bias from selecting weaker students into tutoring. Specifically, by using more sophisticated methods than previous analysis, the team addressed *regression to the mean* and *Simpson's paradox* effects that can otherwise distort simple pre-post comparisons.
