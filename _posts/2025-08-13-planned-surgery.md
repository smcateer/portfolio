A member of my team contributed to this audit by extracting and standardising data from the Elective Surgery Information System and hospital submissions, enabling the audit team to track throughput, monitor changes in the waiting list and compare activity levels with the Catch Up Plan’s stated targets. They developed indicators that made the underlying patterns in treatment volumes and wait times clear and interpretable for the rest of the audit team.

They also examined gaps in system coverage caused by smaller services that do not submit data and built a reconciliation method to estimate how much activity is missing from statewide figures. This work helped the audit team understand weaknesses in current data collection and supported findings about the need for broader data capture and better monitoring of long waiters.
