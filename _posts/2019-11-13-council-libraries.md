In this audit, we used [data envelopment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_envelopment_analysis) to investigate the efficiencies of council libraries. The inputs included library FTE and collection size, and outputs included number of loans, opening hours and program attendance. We were able to draw conclusions about the relative efficiencies of library service delivery models.

See the [full report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/council-libraries) for details of the analysis and findings.
