**data.gov.au** maintains data on [Australian Public holidays](https://data.gov.au/dataset/australian-holidays-machine-readable-dataset), but needs some massaging to get it into usable format. I wrote a cheap-and-nasty Python script for downloading and shaping the data into a more usable form. [Click to view code](https://gist.github.com/smcateer/8930c8f4fcb96830e5e51345352df776).

The output is a single Pandas DataFrame in the following format:

| | STATE | DATE | HOLIDAY_NAME | INFORMATION | MORE_INFORMATION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | ACT | 2015-01-01 | New Year's Day | New Year's Day is the first day of the calenda... | NaN |
| 1 | ACT | 2015-01-26 | Australia Day | Always celebrated on 26 January | http://www.australiaday.org.au/ |
| 2 | ACT | 2015-04-03 | Good Friday | Easter is celebrated with Good Friday and East... | NaN |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

I said all I have to say about this in the code comments. :)
