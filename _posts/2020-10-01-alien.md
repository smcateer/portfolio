I was watching [an episode of Star Trek](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/First_Contact_(episode)) and some of the alien signage displayed in the background reminded me of the album art on [Exai by Autechre](https://www.discogs.com/Autechre-Exai/master/519732). I read somewhere that the cover is an experiment in typography, and the forms not unlike the alien signage.

Anyway, that inspired me to create an *alien information display* ... something that you might see on a display in the background of an alien ship on Star Trek.
