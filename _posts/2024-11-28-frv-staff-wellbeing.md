In this performance audit, we looked at how Fire Rescue Victoria (FRV) supports the wellbeing of its staff, including mental health initiatives and workplace culture. To support the audit, the Data Science team helped design the survey and produced descriptive analysis of the results.

One innovation we applied in this audit was the use of Power BI to ingest and visualise survey data. This allowed us to quickly re-run the analysis as we received updated survey data and to refine our approach in a documented and transparent way. It also provided a solid platform for peer review and quality assurance of the analysis.
