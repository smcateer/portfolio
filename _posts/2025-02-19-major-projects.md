The Victorian Auditor‑General’s Office’s Major Projects Performance Reporting review presents attested data from 113 major public-sector projects (with total estimated investment of around $145.5 billion) surveyed across 15 agencies. Several members of my team have worked on the development of this dashboard, which provides an interactive way to explore project performance data over time.

It enables users to explore changes in cost, time, scope and benefits, compare across sectors  and examine entities’ self-assessments, thereby supporting transparent performance-reporting of large-scale capital investments. 

Explore the dashboard and read the report [here](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/major-projects-performance-reporting-2024).
