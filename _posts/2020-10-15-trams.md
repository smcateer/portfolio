This audit includes an interactive dashboard that allows the public to explore and understand the accessibility of Melbourne's tram network. It allows users to understand the additional wait-times experienced by mobility impaired tram users and the geospatial distribution of accessible tram stops.

The audit also includes analysis of the impact of adding more accessible tram stops using ABS Census data and geospatial data on tram stop location.

See the [full report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/accessibility-tram-services?) to explore the dashboard and the analytics results.
