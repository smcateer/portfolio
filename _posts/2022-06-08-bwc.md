I was involved in the design (but not execution) of this piece of analytics that involved fuzzy-joining datasets (police activity and camera metadata), statistical analysis and computational optimization. The result was the first calculation of an estimate of compliance with body-worn camera usage regulations.

The compliance rate was a key finding of the audit and was a milestone in demonstrating the utility of data science in performance audit at VAGO.
