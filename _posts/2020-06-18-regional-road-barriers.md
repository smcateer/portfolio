In this audit, we used Poisson modelling to evaluate the extent to which regional road barriers reduced fatalities and serious injuries. It was based on two datasets. Geospatial data on the location of the barriers (and their installation dates), and road crash data.

See the [full report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/safety-victorias-roads-regional-road-barriers) for details of the analysis and findings.
