A data scientist on my team analysed WorkSafe claims, survey data, and hospital workforce records to assess how well psychosocial risks were managed in Victorian hospitals. They compared injury rates and costs, tracked stress trends from People Matter and Department of Health surveys, and examined time-sheet data to estimate fatigue risk using Queensland Health benchmarks.

Their analysis showed rising psychological injury claims, worsening stress indicators, and widespread fatigue risksâ€”especially for doctors. The analysis demonstrated that while hospitals collect rich HR and safety data, the Department of Health relies too heavily on surveys and lacks integrated, real-time monitoring to manage employee wellbeing effectively.
