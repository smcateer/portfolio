This is a great example of how data scientists can add value to an engagement without directly carrying out data analysis. As part of the planing phase of this audit, a member of our data science team was engaged to provide subject matter expertise on cloud computing products and cybersecurity issues. They produced a "white paper" that helped the audit team understand the technical landscape, identify key risks, and shape the audit approach.

[The report](https://www.audit.vic.gov.au/report/cybersecurity-cloud-computing-products) was tabled by the Victorian Auditor-General's Office on 16 August 2023.
